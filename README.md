## Overview

This repository contains the code for a 4-page website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

 * Home page (index.html)
 * Stories page (stories.html)
 * Features page (features.html)
 * Pricing page (pricing.html)



### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Layout and design: Creating an attractive and functional design for the website can be challenging. You may need to spend time researching different design options and experimenting with different layouts, color schemes, and typography.
- Responsive design: Ensuring that the website looks good and functions well on a variety of screen sizes and devices can be challenging. You may need to use CSS media queries and other techniques to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- JavaScript functionality: Adding JavaScript functionality to the website can be challenging, especially if you are new to programming. You may need to spend time learning JavaScript and experimenting with different scripts to achieve the desired functionality.
- Teamwork: working with each others we could exchange experience but collaboration and organize teamwork was rather challenging.

### What We learned

Working with team an exchange experience. keep track of each others work, dive into other's code and get some insights.
Project was voluminous and required quite lot of skills from each contributor. First of all, organizing the work, Systematization of the code and managing the project was most valuable. 
Also we used the knowledge of markup (HTML CSS) and put it in some work with javaScript and gained quite an experience from this.
